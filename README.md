The project of my students. The task is to create an application for renting various goods. 

The entire functional part is stored in a file app.py .

As a result, the project will be divided into a structure that will be stored in the RentEase directory. (due to time constraints, there are errors in it now)


Functional: registration and authorization, loadings, catalogue loadings, management of loadings, administrative panel
